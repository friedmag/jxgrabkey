  JXGrabKey now throws a HotkeyConflictException on registerHotkey

2009/01/23: JXGrabKey 0.1.3
- 0.1.2 did not fix the issue properly, reverted back to XGrabKey method
- implemented XErrorHandler, which solved the issue by catching the error

2009/01/18: JXGrabKey 0.1.2

  crashes if the specified key was already registered by another application 
  -> see bug 2440751 (CTRL+F8 on Xubuntu)

2009/01/01: JXGrabKey 0.1.1
