2009/1/23: JXGrabKey 0.1.3
- 0.1.2 did not fix the issue properly, reverted back to XGrabKey method
- implemented XErrorHandler, which solved the issue by catching the error

2009/1/18: JXGrabKey 0.1.2
- changed implementation to use XGrabKeyboard instead of XGrabKey as XGrabKey causes 
  crashes if the specified key was already registered by another application 
  -> see bug 2440751 (CTRL+F8 on Xubuntu)

2009/1/1: JXGrabKey 0.1.1
- jxgrabkey now terminating properly when cleanUp is called
- renamed registerSwingHotkey to registerAWTHotkey, because it is more technically correct

2008/12/14: JXGrabKey 0.1.0
- feature complete as in what we need
